    <h1 className="title">Fresh out of the oven: Garlicoin</h1>
    <h2 className="subTitle">Garlicoin is a new, freshly baked cryptocurrency, born from the shitposts of Reddit.</h2>
    <p>On December 25, 2017, Reddit user u/DigitalizedOrange presented his dream to the newly-found Garlicoin community: to create a cryptocurrency to revolutionize the memecoin market. Shortly there-after, the community exploded into action - a development team was assembled rapidly and the testnet went live shortly after. On the 21st of January at 2pm EST, the mainnet was made public and the memecoin market was changed forever.</p>
    <p>Garlicoin formed on a few simple fundamentals - cheap and fast transactions, low barrier to entry and total focus on the community. These fundamentals have been put into practice, resulting in Garlicoin being a triumphant success: 40 second block times allow for blazingly fast confirmations, our ASIC resistant proof-of-work algorithm means anyone with a GPU can contribute to mining, and many important decisions have been made by the rapidly growing Garlicoin community.</p>
